# SMW asset extraction as a verifiable wasm module

A rewrite of `assets/restool.py` + `compile_resources.py` + `util.py` as a
single wasm module that takes a Super Mario World ROM and returns
`smw_assets.dat`. Output is byte-for-byte identical to the Python.

    ROM (in linear memory)  ->  [ wasm module ]  ->  smw_assets.dat

The point is not "Python in a browser". The point is that a stranger's web tool
can fetch this module and run it on a user's proprietary ROM *without trusting
this repository*, because the module's inability to do anything except
transform bytes is checkable from the binary. It **imports nothing at all** —
no filesystem, no network, no clock, no randomness, no JS bridge.

This repo is the reference implementation of a pattern other game ports are
meant to copy, so the machinery here is deliberately project-independent.

| `manifest.mjs` | release manifest generator |
| `record-reference.mjs` | records verified output hashes, run only by `check.sh` |
| `test.mjs` | verifier tests: non-conformant modules that must be rejected |
| `test-abi.mjs` | ABI behaviour: errors, flags, cancellation, stepped/one-shot parity |
| `test-page.mjs` | drives the published page in a real browser |
| `page/` | the manual conversion site ([`page/README.md`](page/README.md)) |
| `build-page.sh` | assembles `site/` from the page and the built module |

## Build and test

```console
$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
$ ./check.sh                      # build, verifier tests, conformance
$ ./check.sh /path/to/smw.sfc     # also parity against the Python, and ABI tests
```

`check.sh` uses whichever `cargo` is first on `PATH`; with both a distro rustc
and rustup installed, make sure `~/.cargo/bin` comes first or the wasm target
will appear to be missing.

The page:

```console
$ ./build-page.sh && (cd site && python3 -m http.server 8731)
$ node test-page.mjs                 # load-only checks, no ROM needed
$ node test-page.mjs /path/to/smw.sfc # full run, needs playwright
```

There is also a native binary (`cargo build --release`, then
`target/release/smw-restool-cli <rom> <out>`) running the identical code path
without a wasm runtime. It exists so the port can be diffed against the Python
directly; it is not a release artifact.

Roughly 11 ms per extraction including verification and instantiation, versus
~95 ms for the warm Python — but the real difference is 95 KB and no network
against ~10 MB of runtime plus PyPI installs.
